A repository created for me to study and delve into using `Pytest`.

# test_sample.py

It's a simple code to base and modify and understand the primary codes

Therefore, the test_answer() test function checks whether the one() function is working correctly, that is, whether it returns the expected value when called with the 3 argument. If the one(3) function returns the value 5, the test and approved. Otherwise, if the function returns a different value, the test fails.


# test_unittest_cleandir.py

This code imports the unittest and pytest modules and defines a test class called MyTest, which inherits from the unittest.TestCase class.
The test_method() method inside the MyTest test class checks whether a text file named samplefile.ini contains the string "testdata". To do this, the method opens the samplefile.ini file, reads its contents and checks if the string "testdata" is present. If the string is present, the test is considered to have passed.
